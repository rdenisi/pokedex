- **FunTranslations API** - https://funtranslations.com/

## Prerequisites

## Solution structure

The solution contains a WebAPI project and a Unit Test project:

- **Pokedex.API**
- **Poxedex.Tests**

## API 

- **GET /api/pokemon/{pokemonName}**   
  Retrieves the requested pokemon name informations.

- **GET /api/pokemon/translated/{pokemonName}**  
  Retrieves the requested pokemon name informations, but with a "fun translation" of its description.   
  The rules are:

  - For all other Pokemon, apply the Shakespeare translation.
  - If you canâ€™t translate the Pokemonâ€™s description (for whatever reason ðŸ˜‰) then use the standard description
